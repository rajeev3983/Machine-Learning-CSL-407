1) Files submitted:

The submitted zip folder contains the following files:
a) hw1.m : It is the main file for quesition 1.
b) mylinridgereg.m : Function file for calculating the weights.
c) mylinridgeregval.m : Function file for predicting the target attribute.
d) meansquarederr.m : Function file for finding the mean Squared error from predicted and acutual values of target attribute.
e) predictedVsActualPlot.m : Function file for plotting a graph between the actual value and the predicted value of the target attribute.
f) removeLeastSignificantAttribute.m : Function file for removing least significant attribute.
g) changesOnRemovingLeastSignificantAttribute.m : Function file for plotting the graph before and after removing two least significant weights.

2) How to run the code:

Just run the hw1 file from the matlab interpreter. The code plots the following four graphs.
a) Average Mean Squared Error Vs Lambda for different values of training fraction.
b) Minimum Average MSE Vs Training Fraction ( subplot 1) and Lambda for Minimum Average MSE Vs Training Fraction ( subplot 2 ).
c) Predicted Vs Actual Value of Target attribut for the best value of lambda and training fraction.
d) Average MSE before and after removing the least significant attributes.
